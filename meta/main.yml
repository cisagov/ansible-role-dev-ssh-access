  # With the release of version 2.10, Ansible finally correctly
  # identifies Kali Linux as being the Kali distribution of the Debian
  # OS family.  This simplifies a lot of things for roles that support
  # Kali Linux, so it makes sense to force the installation of Ansible
  # 2.10 or newer.

    # I'm having some problems getting the Amazon Linux 2 build to
    # pass.  Since we aren't currently using Amazon Linux, and since
    # this role will soon go away in favor of using EC2 Instance
    # Connect for dynamic key management, I will simply remove Amazon
    # Linux 2 for now.
